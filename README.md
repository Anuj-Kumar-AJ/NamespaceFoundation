### **About Namespace**

Namespace is a development platform which is helps you manage your development, testing and production workflows.

- **Manages your builds** so you don't have to manage Dockerfiles manually, manage dependencies that you would need to install your workstation, ensuring that builds are fast and correct, and that you the information you need to understand what gets built into your images.

- **Offers a robust stateful development workflow** which allows you to develop against production-like environments, as if those services would be running in your own workstation.

- **Simplifies using Kubernetes** so you and your team can think about the semantics you care about: services, resources, backends, etc. Under the covers you'll find the industry-standard Kubernetes and CNCF projects; but if you don't have a need to, you don't need to look under the covers.

- **Packages dependencies** so using a piece of infrastructure -- whether it's S3, a database, a messaging system, etc -- it's as simple as adding a dependency to your application.

### **Getting Started**
